ASSIGNMENT 2
1.Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Fundamental concepts of Version Control
•	Repository-is a storage location for projects files and their histories. They can be local or remote.
•	Commits-is a representation of a snapshot of the project at a particular point in time.
•	Branches-they allow one to diverge from the main line of development to work on different tasks independently.
•	Tags-are used to mark specific points in the repository’s history.
Why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code
•	It uses git which allows developers to work offline, maintain a complete history, and manage complex workflows.
•	It has remote repositories  
•	It provides security alerts for vulnerabilities and tools that help address security issues.
How does version control help in maintaining project integrity
•	It allows one to revert previous versions of code or datasets with ease
•	Acts as a safety net for data integrity by providing a comprehensive history of changes made to file, documents or code over time
•	Help manage conflicts by providing tools to resolve the thus this ensures changes are merged correctly and conflicting changes are resolved.
